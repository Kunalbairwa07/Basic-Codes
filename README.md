# 🚀 C++ Fundamentals – The Beginning of My DSA Journey

Welcome! 👋 This repository marks the **starting point of my journey into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++** — one of the most powerful languages for mastering problem-solving and system-level programming.

## 📚 What This Repository Is About

This is not just a collection of basic C++ programs —  
it’s a **well-structured foundation** that I’m building as the **first step toward mastering DSA**.

Every concept here is a building block — from understanding how loops work to structuring logical conditions — all essential for cracking real-world coding problems and competitive programming.

## 🧠 Topics Covered (So Far):

- 📥 Input / Output Handling
- 🔢 Variables & Data Types
- 📈 Arithmetic & Logical Operators
- 🔀 Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `switch`)
- 🔁 Looping Constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- ➗ Basic Calculations (Sum, Factorial, Calculator App)
- 📆 Leap Year Checker
- 🧮 Pattern Printing (coming soon)
- 🧩 Problem-Solving Mindset (built-in comments & logic)

This repo will **evolve** as I grow through:
- Advanced C++ concepts
- DSA techniques (arrays, strings, recursion, etc.)
- Competitive-level problem-solving
